# MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

## Scenario
Mapped attacker behavior observed in labs to MITRE ATT&CK techniques to understand tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

## Techniques Used
- Initial Access
- Execution
- Persistence
- Command and Control

## Tools Used
- MITRE ATT&CK framework
- IOC research
- Open threat reports

## What I Learned
- How to classify attacker behavior
- How SOC teams use MITRE ATT&CK to understand threats
- How to map observed attacks to real-world techniques
